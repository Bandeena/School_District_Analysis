# School District Analysis

### Overview
This Analysis of data from a school district was processed to examine the possibility of falsified testing scores at one of the schools in this district, Thomas High School. To do so, I replaced the questionable scores with a placeholder that allowed me to recalculate and compare the analysis without the numbers being affected by those values. 

### Results

  - As you can see, the differences between district summaries is minimal:
